<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Emmanuel Lawal, I'm a student of Olabis Onabanjo University. 
  I am currently in 500 level in the deartment of civil engineering, under the falculty of engineering. 
  It's been fun and stressful at the same time studying the course i'm studying. 
  All i can say is i bless God for everything.</p>



<p>I started my programming learning journey in the year 2024 with the help of a friend of mine.
  He recommended me getting a course from Udemy under the tutor of the great instructor named Anjela Yu.
  And i must say, this is one of the best decisions i've made in my life. 
  So far, i've only learnt HTML, just about to start CSS and then move to JavaScript.
</p>

<p>So far so good, i love programming and i can't wait to learn more and become a 
  full stack developer in the nearest future. With enough practice, hard work and determination, 
  one can be in the University and still learn a course outside the University, and i believe i will get there.
